# Data Analysis and Visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib

## 📌 Objective
This project demonstrates how to:
- Load and explore a dataset using the **pandas** library.
- Perform basic data analysis.
- Visualize the data using **matplotlib** and **seaborn**.

## 🧪 Tasks Performed

### 1. Load and Explore the Dataset
- Loaded data using `pandas`.
- Displayed the first few rows with `.head()`.
- Checked for missing values and data types using `.info()` and `.isnull().sum()`.
- Cleaned data by dropping or filling missing values.

### 2. Basic Data Analysis
- Descriptive statistics with `.describe()`.
- Grouped by a categorical column and calculated mean values.
- Identified patterns and key observations.

### 3. Data Visualization
Created the following visualizations:
- 📈 Line chart for trends over time.
- 📊 Bar chart comparing categories.
- 📉 Histogram for distribution of a numeric column.
- ⚫ Scatter plot for relationships between numeric columns.

## 🛠 Libraries Used
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn (if applicable)

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) or run the Python script (`.py`) in your IDE.
3. Make sure you have the required libraries installed:
